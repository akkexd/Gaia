**Giaia - Carbon Footprint Calculator**
Giaia is a Python-based carbon footprint calculator that allows users to calculate their carbon footprint in three categories: transportation, waste, and electricity. Additionally, Giaia offers a feature that allows users to use their device's camera to take a photo and use object detection AI to identify items that contribute to carbon footprint.

This project was initiated during the HubandHack 2023 hackathon by the team of Wint Kay Khine, Thiri Myat Hsu, Thurein Lin, Shine Lin Zay Yar, and the team mentor, Aung Khant Ko.

**Installation**
To use Giaia, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your device. Clone this repository and run the main.py file to launch the GUI using tkinter.
< git clone https://github.com/username/Giaia.git
cd Giaia
python main.py
>
**Usage**
Once you have launched Giaia, the GUI will be displayed. You can choose one of three options to calculate your carbon footprint for transportation, waste, or electricity. Additionally, you can use the "Vision" feature to capture a photo and use object detection AI to identify items that contribute to carbon footprint.

After selecting an option, enter the required information into the fields provided, and click the "Calculate" button. The result will be displayed in the GUI.
